                            Discreet Drop is a Buffalo-based startup founded in 2017 by Kevin Skompinski, serving to create a way to make sure that every item people order can arrive to them as discreet as possible. We serve as a shipment processor, where people can ship their packages to us via a unique address, we double-box the package to cover up any external logos, return labels, packing slips, holes; anything that can act as identifying information and can be used to signal what's in the box. Then we ship the plain box out to the customer so it will arrive completely discreet, and nobody but the customer would be able to figure out what's in the package.

                            Honestly, it depends! Shipping costs vary greatly depending on the size and weight of the package you've ordered. We've built a simple <a href="pricing-calculator">pricing calculator page</a> that you can use to estimate the latest shipping costs, depending on your best guess as to the package size and weight of the item you've ordered. Shipping will also cost more depending on how far away you are from our processing facility, so the <a href="pricing-calculator">pricing calculator page</a> can help you see how much shipping to your zip code will be. The <a href="pricing-calculator">pricing calculator page</a> also provides a breakdown on the shipping cost and our small fee we need to charge to cover processing, handling, and shipping materials for your package. Discreet Drop uses the lowest-cost Commercial Plus Pricing through the USPS to provide the cheapest possible shipping rates for you.

                            In order to streamline the process from when we receive a package for you to shipping it out for final delivery, we require your shipping profile to be completed with your address and payment information saved and ready to use. This allows us to be have all the information we need on hand to quickly and properly process your shipment so you get your package as soon as possible. It will also allow you to keep your Discreet Drop address saved with your sellers so you cna use it any time without having to visit your Discreet Drop dashboard to generate a new code, so if and when we ever get a package for you, we'll know just what to do with it without having to contact you and get payment information every time in order to send your package to you, saving time and effort. If you end up signing up but never using Discreet Drop, don't worry, we will only ever charge your card if we receive a package to process and send out to you.
