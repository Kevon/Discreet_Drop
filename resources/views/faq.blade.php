                            Discreet Drop is a Buffalo-based startup founded in 2017 by Kevin Skompinski, serving to create a way to make sure that every item people order can arrive to them as discreet as possible. We serve as a shipment processor, where people can ship their packages to us via a unique address, we double-box the package to cover up any external logos, return labels, packing slips, holes; anything that can act as identifying information and can be used to signal what's in the box. Then we ship the plain box out to the customer so it will arrive completely discreet, and nobody but the customer would be able to figure out what's in the package.

                            Discreet Drop is the only way to guarantee 100% discreet shipping on any package, from any seller. Discreet Drop offers a way to cover up any and all logos, return labels, packing slips, customs forms, and holes in the packaging so nobody but you will be able to figure out what's in your private packages. Even websites that advertise discreet shipping will still have a return label which has a name and return address, both of which can be easily Googled that'll indicate what kind of item is in your package. Privacy is important, and with Discreet Drop, your personal packages remain private, so only you will know what's in the box.

                            Lots of reasons! If you live in a home with multiple people, appartment complex with a common area, dorm housing for college, or just live by yourself but arent always home to receive your packages, discreet packages will help prevent anyone else from figuring out what you've ordered online. This is helpful for hiding your personal items that you want to keep secret from everyone else, concealing gifts you've ordered for other memebrs of your home to prevent them from finding out what it is, or just hiding desirable brand logos from attracting any unwanted and potentially costly attention from others. Discreet Drop uses plain-box packaging to hide all identifying information, so nobody else will be able to figure out what's in your package.

                            That just means that the box they ship in doesn't have any obvious logos or branding on the side. The package will still have a return address on the label, and with a quick Google search of that return address or name on the label, will instantly show the website of the seller who sent the package. Anyone can do this to figure out what's inside your package. International orders must also have an attached customs form to enter the country with a detailed list of the items in the box. So while they may offer discreet shipping, it's not really discreet and there are several easy ways to figure out what's in any box. The package can also be easily ripped or opened in transit, and our system double-boxes your packages to prevent any holes from appearing that'll show what's inside your shipment. Discreet Drop prevents anyone but you from knowing what's inside your package by covering up these return labels, packing slips, customs forms, and holes, in addition to any logos on the box is a seller does not offer discreet shipping in the first place.

                            Yes! We live in the information age and all that information is just a quick Google search away. Even if your packages don't contain any obvious logos, the return label will ALWAYS be visible and either the name or return address on that label can be easily Googled, with the top results showing the company that sent your order. It doesn't take much from there to figure out what kind of items are in the box, and anyone can figure out what is in your package. With discreet Drop, we remove that possibility from happening to keep your secret items truly a secret.

                            Honestly, it depends! Shipping costs vary greatly depending on the size and weight of the package you've ordered. We've built a simple <a href="pricing-calculator">pricing calculator page</a> that you can use to estimate the latest shipping costs, depending on your best guess as to the package size and weight of the item you've ordered. Shipping will also cost more depending on how far away you are from our processing facility, so the <a href="pricing-calculator">pricing calculator page</a> can help you see how much shipping to your zip code will be. The <a href="pricing-calculator">pricing calculator page</a> also provides a breakdown on the shipping cost and our small fee we need to charge to cover processing, handling, and shipping materials for your package. Discreet Drop uses the lowest-cost Commercial Plus Pricing through the USPS to provide the cheapest possible shipping rates for you.

                            Once you sign up and complete your shipping profile, your dashboard page will contain a unique generated Discreet Drop address. Use this address instead of your normal home address when checking-out online, so your packages will be sent to our facilities instead. From there, we receive your package and place the entire box into a slightly larger box to cover up any and all logos, return labels, holes, packing slips, and customs forms. Then we send the completely discreet plain-box package containing your original package to you in a double-box for additional item protection. since your Discreet Drop address is unique, we know exactly who each package we receive belongs to, and we automaticaly handle the payment details and shipping destination according to your shipping profile, without you having to do anything. You use this same Discreet Drop address for any number of packages as you'd like, and we'll handle them all without a problem. We make this as easy as possible.

                            In order to streamline the process from when we receive a package for you to shipping it out for final delivery, we require your shipping profile to be completed with your address and payment information saved and ready to use. This allows us to be have all the information we need on hand to quickly and properly process your shipment so you get your package as soon as possible. It will also allow you to keep your Discreet Drop address saved with your sellers so you cna use it any time without having to visit your Discreet Drop dashboard to generate a new code, so if and when we ever get a package for you, we'll know just what to do with it without having to contact you and get payment information every time in order to send your package to you, saving time and effort.

                            Yes!

                            If your package ends up exceeding the 130 inch combined length plus girth restioction the USPS has on packages, your package will be sent out via FedEx which is the cheapest option in handling larger packages. FedEx has a combined length plus girth restriction of 170 inches. Since this option costs more than using USPS normally, we try to avoid using it unless absolutely necessary.

                            Once your package arrives to our facility, it won't take more than a day for it to be process and sent out to you. After that, it usually takes around 2 to 4 days for the package to be delivered to you, depending on your location.
